# Cloning Datasets

{% include warning.html content="Cloning a dataset does not copy any dataset files. Cloning a dataset is the same as creating a new dataset, where the metadata details are prefilled from an existing dataset." %}

Cloning a dataset is the same as [cloning other Registry items](../registry/clone). However, you initiate the clone operation from the [Data Store](./overview).

If you have sufficient [permissions](../registry/clone#required-permissions), the "Clone Dataset" button will appear (1).

Cloning a Dataset is no different to cloning other [Registry](../registry/overview) entity types - the metadata details will be prefilled.

The same considerations apply as mentioned in [cloning registry items](../registry/clone).
