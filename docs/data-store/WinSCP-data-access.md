## Overview

[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php){:target="\_blank"} is a client tool for Microsoft Windows.  It allows for managing files between a local computer and remote servers.  As RRAP data is stored in AWS S3 buckets WinSCP can be used to transfer data to and from the data store.

### Required inputs to establish connection
