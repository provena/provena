Provena is general purpose dataset and provenance management system. 
It features a general purpose metadata registry that allows registration of a provenance record and their compositional elements, and the ability to mint a persistent identifier for each element, e.g. entities like datasets, model run workflows and people involved in the modelling. 
Persistent identifiers allows linkages to be created between entities, people, and model workflow activities using standard PROV-O semantics. 
Linking up each of these elements provides a provenance chain between activities, entities and people which can be queries. 

Provena uses an optimised query engine implementing a graph database to enable provenance specific query capabilities that supporting queries such as inspecting all upstream lineage activities and inputs from a single output dataset.
