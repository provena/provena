# Groups overview

The RRAP M&DS IS provides the ability to define groups and access to grant access to resources
in the IS on a group-by-group basis. A group is simply a construct that is defined in the IS with a name and a set of users as members of the group. Each resource in the RRAP M&DS IS, e.g. a dataset, can then be configured to allow access to have read and/or write permissions. For example, a dataset on the RRAP M&DS IS Data Store can be made available to one or more groups with differing levels of read/write access.

Currently groups apply to datasets in the RRAP M&DS IS. However, group access control functionality may be
offered in other RRAP M&DS IS components and resources in the future.

# Requesting a new group

If you would a new group, you will need to send request for a new group to be added.

Step 1. To request a new group, please submit a request via the M&DS IS Issues tracker via this link:
[https://github.com/gbrrestoration/mds-is-issues/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/gbrrestoration/mds-is-issues/issues/new/choose)

Step 2. In "Request a new group", click on the "Get started" button to initiate a request issue (see screenshot below).

|                       Request a group via the Github issue tracker                        |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

Step 3. Add details for the request for a new group (see screenshot below). It would be useful to add the
group name in the issue title. In the body of the issue, edit the text to describe
the group, and any additional context. For example, this might include
a list of members needed in the group.

|                              Add details for group request                               |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="../assets/images/request-a-group-issue-create.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/> |

Step 4. Click the submit button.

Once submitted, a notification will be sent to the IS team, who will administer the request. You will be contacted to confirm details for the group.

Once the group is created, you may use it in the IS.
