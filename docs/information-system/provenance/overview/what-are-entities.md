# What are entities?

## 1. Overview

In the RRAP M&DS Information System (IS), entities are things that are recorded in the M&DS IS Registry. Registration of entities is fundamental to establishing stable provenance. It establishes a record for each entity used or generated in producing or delivering an artifact in a provenance record.

In the RRAP M&DS IS, each registered item (entity) is allocated a unique and persistent identifier (ID) upon successful registration. These IDs provide a mechanism for 2 things:

1. It allows information to be attached to each entity in a defined way
2. Entities are able to link to other entities (i.e. object cross-references rather than just text descriptions)

In addition to this, the persistent IDs for each entity in the RRAP M&DS IS is able to be hyperlinked and looked up in the IS via the web.

These registered entities can then referenced in provenance records, e.g. a provenance record about a model run references a computational model that was used, the agent or person who ran the model, a list of input datasets, and the output dataset/results. The ability to refer to entities reduces manual error and duplication of descriptions, as they can be reused and simply referred to.

Registering provenance records using cross-references to the registered entity provides the IS with the ability to create provenance graphs. Provenance graphs provide a representation of the provenance data, where nodes in the graph are entities, and links between the nodes are associations and relationships between them. An example of a provenance graph is shown below relating the Model Run record (MR) with input and output datasets (D) from that model run as well as the Agent/Person who ran it (P):

Provenance graphs provide users with a way to explore, query and traverse lineage of entities like datasets to the parent activities and entities upstream. The RRAP M&DS IS provides tools for navigating provenance graphs.

## 2. What entity types are used in the RRAP M&DS IS?

### 2.1. Underlying conceptual model

The underlying conceptual model for entities in the RRAP M&DS IS uses PROV-O. As depicted in the image below, 3 core concepts are defined:

-   Entity
-   Agent
-   Activity

![PROV-O Conceptual Model](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/W3C_PROV_Data_Model.svg/661px-W3C_PROV_Data_Model.svg.png "PROV-O Conceptual Model")

"An entity is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary" [1]. An _Entity_ represents a thing in the world. An entity may be derived from other entities, and may be generated by an _Activity_ that used a set of entities.

An _Activity_ "is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities". [1]

"An _Agent_ is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity [1]. This may be a person or a piece of software that is executed and associated with the activity that generates the Entity. It provides a way to attribute the activity and generation of the Entity to that agent. The _Agent_ class could be considered as a sub-class of Entity, however, for the purposes of the IS and PROV, we treat it as an Abstract type at the same level as Entity and Activity.

### 2.2. RRAP M&DS IS Conceptual Model

In RRAP M&DS, the PROV-O model is extended to enable capture of provenance information relating to model run workflows and other related information (input data, associated modellers, outputs data, modelling software/processes) (see figure below).

The specialised types used in M&DS IS are provided below:
