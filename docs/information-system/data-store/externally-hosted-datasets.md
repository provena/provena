# Externally Hosted Datasets

## What is an externally hosted dataset?

By default, datasets registered in the [Data Store](./index) include dataset files which are hosted as part of the Information System. There are various reasons which could make it a better choice to instead reference an existing source of the dataset files, e.g.

-   Dataset size - if the dataset is extremely large, it may be cost prohibitive to rehost it
-   Unnecessary duplication - if the dataset is already hosted in a reliable external repository, there is no need to rehost it in the Data Store

If you are unsure about whether a dataset can or should be stored in the Data Store, please get in touch with us.

## What can I do with an externally hosted dataset?

Externally hosted datasets behave identically to normal Datasets with two exceptions:

-   Downloading files - there is no way to download dataset files using the Data Store website or API endpoints
-   Uploading files - there is no way to upload dataset files using the Data Store website or API endpoints

If you need to download or upload files - you should consult the "External Access" tab of the Dataset detail view, and follow the instructions included by the registrant of the dataset.
