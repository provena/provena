## How do I request access to the data store?

You should make a user access request by visiting the [landing portal](https://mds.gbrrestoration.org){:target="\_blank"} and pressing your profile (user silhouette in the top right) then choosing Roles. Information about how to use this menu and which roles you should request is available at [request access](./getting-started-is/requesting-access-is.html){:target="\_blank"}.

## How do I get an RRAP-IS AWS account?

If you have logged in to the RRAP IS system and have requested the appropriate roles then you are setup and ready to access protected AWS resources. Users of the RRAP-IS do not directly possess or own AWS accounts, rather we broker temporary credentials on your behalf as an authorised user of the system. When undertaking actions that require AWS access credentials, they will be generated automatically for you. For information about logging in see [logging in](./getting-started-is/logging-in.html){:target="\_blank"}. For information about requesting access see [requesting access](./getting-started-is/requesting-access-is.html){:target="\_blank"}.

## How do I find a dataset someone else has uploaded?

Firstly, ensure that you have [logged in](./getting-started-is/logging-in.html){:target="\_blank"} and have requested data store [access](./getting-started-is/requesting-access-is.html){:target="\_blank"} (at least read level). You can now visit the [data store](https://data.mds.gbrrestoration.org){:target="\_blank"}, login and select Datasets from the banner. From this menu, you will see a list of registered datasets. You can search this list (noting that the search functionality is currently limited) and filter by organisation. Once you have selected the dataset you wish to view, you can click it in the list. From here, there are instructions on how to [view this dataset](./data-store/viewing-a-dataset.html){:target="\_blank"} or [download the files](./data-store/downloading-datasets.md){:target="\_blank"}.

## How do I find datasets that have been uploaded by my organisation?

By following the above procedure, you will have access to the list of datasets in the [data store](https://data.mds.gbrrestoration.org){:target="\_blank"}. You can filter by organisation using the clickable tick boxes in the left panel.

## How do I log a fault?

In all of the M&DS IS web pages there is a button on the right side of the page; "Contact Us". Pressing this button will show a structured form you can fill out to report an issue to the development team. Please include as much pertinent information as you can to help us quickly identify and resolve the issue. We will contact you via the email provided as the status of the issue changes.

## Can I upload data on behalf of someone, as I'm not the owner of the data?

In some cases, it might be useful to republish a dataset in the RRAP M&DS IS for various reasons, e.g. automation, and long term storage of important data.
For this reason, users can upload other people's data as long as they have permission or rights to republish that data. It may be useful to add this information to the dataset (e.g. written permission in an email attachment file, or description of details in the README file).

## My computer crashed while uploading the data - how do I see what was loaded?

The answer to this question depends on how far you made it before the big bang. If you successfully [registered the dataset](./data-store/registering-and-uploading-a-dataset.md){:target="\_blank"} then the entry exists in the registry and upload can be resumed. If you did not complete registration, you will need to start the process again. Once an entry exists (through registration), you can add files to it at any point by visiting the entry in the [data store](https://data.mds.gbrrestoration.org){:target="\_blank"}. After registering the dataset you may also like to take note of the handle link so that you can easily get back there later. If you were in the middle of uploading files when a crash occurred, you can use the instructions on the 'upload' tab of the dataset view in the data store as required to continue the upload. To view what's there you can use the AWS console GUI or the `aws s3 ls` command. If you want to resume your upload using the GUI you will need to assess what uploads were complete and choose the remaining files to upload (or simply upload the whole dataset again, noting that this will require uploading all the files again). If you used the AWS CLI, then you will be able to use the same `aws s3 sync` command again (the `s3 sync` command **will not upload the same data if it hasn't changed** meaning that your upload will be safely resumed). For this reason (and others) we would recommend using the AWS CLI for large datasets, and particularly for large datasets with numerous files.

## I have new data to add to a data set, how do I go about this?

To add new data to a dataset you must first have write permissions into the data store - for more information on permissions you can visit [requesting access](./getting-started-is/requesting-access-is.html){:target="\_blank"}. Once you have the appropriate permissions, you should locate the dataset. You can do this by visiting a shared [handle](./digital-object-identifiers.html){:target="\_blank"} link or by using the dataset search/listing functionality in the [data store](https://data.mds.gbrrestoration.org){:target="\_blank"}. Once you have found the dataset you wish to modify, select the 'upload' tab of the dataset view. You can then choose to upload files using either the AWS Web Console (first option) or the AWS CLI (second option). For more detailed information about how these upload processes work see [uploading and registering](./data-store/registering-and-uploading-a-dataset.html){:target="\_blank"} and [setting up the AWS CLI](./data-store/setting-up-the-aws-cli.html){:target="\_blank"}. If you use the AWS web console, simply follow the normal steps to upload data, choosing your additional data. If you use the CLI, you can run the usual sync command from the same directory and **only the new files will be uploaded**. For more information about how the AWS CLI sync command works, see [aws sync](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/sync.html){:target="\_blank"}.

## Can I add to someone else's dataset?

Using the [groups](https://gbrrestoration.github.io/rrap-mds-knowledge-hub/information-system/groups.html) feature, users may be granted write access to a dataset belonging to another person. The registrant of the dataset would need to specify a group, and grant it write access (e.g. Group A).
The group would need to specify the required members to be added as users in the group (e.g. Mary in Group A).
If this is configured correctly, the user (e.g. Mary in Group A) will be able to access the dataset as an editor and [upload files to the dataset](https://gbrrestoration.github.io/rrap-mds-knowledge-hub/information-system/data-store/uploading-a-dataset.html#uploading-dataset-files).

## How do I share my dataset?

You can share your dataset with others by using the handle link. See [Collaborating](./data-store/viewing-a-dataset.md.md){:target="\_blank"} for more information.
