<img src="../../../assets/images/provenance/exploring/splash.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

The recording of data and workflow [provenance](../overview/what-is-provenance) enables the exploration of lineage for entities in the [registry](../registry/overview).

The process of exploring provenance involves two steps:

-   [Discovering records](./discovering-records)
-   [Exploring record lineage](./exploring-record-lineage)
