# What is the Registry?

The RRAP Information System Registry is a centralised location to register, update, explore and share [persistently identified](../../digital-object-identifiers.html) resources.

The Registry is a critical part of the [RRAP Provenance Store](../index.html) as it facilitates the creation of and linking between persistently identified artefacts of provenance, such as people, organisations, models and model runs.

# Accessing the registry

## Navigating to the registry

The Registry is hosted at [https://registry.mds.gbrrestoration.org](https://registry.mds.gbrrestoration.org).

## Logging in

Your user session is shared between all RRAP M&DS Components - you may already be logged in. If you are logged in, you will see a profile icon and email address in the upper right hand corner:

|                                      Logged in                                       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="../../../assets/images/registry/logged_in.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/> |

If you are not logged in, you will see a "Click to Login" button in the upper right hand corner:

|                                      Not Logged in                                       |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="../../../assets/images/registry/not_logged_in.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/> |

The login process for the registry is the same as other components, see [logging in](../../getting-started-is/logging-in.html) for more information.

## Requesting access

The process of requesting access for the Registry is the same as other components. See [requesting access](../../getting-started-is/requesting-access-is.html) for more information.
