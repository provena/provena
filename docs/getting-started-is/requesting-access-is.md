## User Roles
Users will need to select **Roles** to be able to perform tasks. Once users are on the RRAP M&DS IS [landing page](https://www.rrap-is.com){:target="\_blank"}, they will need to select **Roles** under their user profile (silhouette of a person <img src="../../assets/images/access/profileIcon.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/>) from the top right of page. From the **Roles** page users can request levels of access (read only, read and write, administration) to particular parts of the system.
