## Definition

Community/species contributed by larval slicks (assumed broader than aquaculture)

Larval enrichment will be simulated as the addition of 1-yr old coral recruits on a set of reefs (ReefMod/CoCoNet) or reef sites (IPMF/CoCoNet). This means that we wonâ€™t simulate settlement from a pool of larvae but rather assume that the intervention resulted in the successful establishment of coral recruits that grew and survived over one year post settlement.
