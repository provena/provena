# February 2023. Release notes RRAP M&DS IS v1.1 "Damselfish"

![v1.1 Damselfish](../../assets/images/release_notes_v1-1/Yellowtail_Damselfish.png)

The RRAP Modelling and Decision Support Information System (RRAP M&DS IS) Version 1.1 features some improvements to version 1.0. Notably, the Registry and Data Store merge, addition of Registry access control and lock features, and enhanced searching in Registry and Data Store.

Refer to previous release notes:
* [v1.0 Clownfish release](https://gbrrestoration.github.io/rrap-mds-knowledge-hub/information-system/release-notes/v1-0.html)

## Version 1.1 
### Main Features

* Merged Data store backend APIs and Registry so that the Data store and registry use the same persistence layers. This reduces duplication in the backend APIs thus streamlining feature development and maintenance as everything is a kind of registry item in the RRAP MDS IS. 
* Registry - Added lock and access control. As a result of the Registry and Data Store merge, the existing functionality for access control and item lock from Data Store has been ported to the merged Data Store and Registry API, thus enabling users to configure access control on registry items and using the lock/unlock feature.
* Search APIs implemented to provide API based search (rather than client side searching). Search is a new feature implemented using the AWS Open Search service as a separate RRAP MDS IS API. It indexes several elements from each registered item in the Registry. As a result, search is more responsive and pagination is implemented to enhance user experience for the Registry and Data Store. 


### Minor features 

* Provenance store visualisation - Adding a workaround to render d3 circle radius in DOM and not CSS, to fix a bug in the visualisation on the Firefox browser not rendering the nodes. 
* Fixing and improving dataset detail view link display
