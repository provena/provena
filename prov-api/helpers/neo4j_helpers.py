        Given a list of neo4j.graph.Path objects, will explore
        the paths using the known structure of the Path object.

        Using a simple approach, a networkx digraph is constructed
        which can be serialised into a D3.js compatible graph 
        style.

        The approach is: 
        - for each path 
            - for each step in relationship of path
                - if start node doesn't exist, add it 
                - if end node doesn't exist, add it 
                - if there is already a relationship between 
                these nodes, then do nothing 
                - else: add a link between nodes with the type 
                attribute set to the name of the prov relation

        This creates a digraph. The only major limitation is that if  
        a graph existed with multiple relations between the same nodes, only
        one such relation is captured.
